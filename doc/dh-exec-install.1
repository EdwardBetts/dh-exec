.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh\-exec\-install is a simple program, meant to be used as the
interpreter for executable debhelper config files, in particular, for
\fIdh_install\fR(1) files. It will refuse to work with any other file.

The purpose of the program is to extend \fIdh_install\fR(1)'s
functionality, by allowing to specify a destination filename. If
\fIdh\-exec\-install\fR encounters a destination that does not end
with a slash, it will assume it is a filename, and attempt to copy the
file itself.

Otherwise it will echo back the results, and let \fIdh_install\fR deal
with it as usual.
