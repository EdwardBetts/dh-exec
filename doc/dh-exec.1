.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh\-exec is a simple program, meant to be used as the interpreter for
executable debhelper config files.

It is a wrapper around the various other helpers (see below), and will
pipe the input file through all of them in turn, using an ordering
that makes most sense in the vast majority of cases.

The order as of now is \fIdh\-exec\-subst\fR gets run first, followed
by \fIdh\-exec\-install\fR, so that variable expansion happens before
files need to be copied.
