dh\-exec \- Debhelper executable file helpers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fB#! /usr/bin/dh\-exec\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh\-exec is a simple program, meant to be used as the interpreter for
executable debhelper config files.

It is a wrapper around the various other helpers (see below), and will
pipe the input file through all of them in turn, using an ordering
that makes most sense in the vast majority of cases.

Since there is only one helper for now, the order is simple: dh\-exec
calls the only available helper. But for future compatibility, it is
recommended to use \fIdh\-exec\fR.
