* dh-exec-install
The syntax needs to be rethought, so that the tool can be enabled
again.

Perhaps something like:

#! /usr/bin/dh-exec-install
usr/lib/libblah.so.*
usr/lib/libblah-plugin-*.so /usr/lib/blah/${UPSTREAM_VERSION}/
etc/whatever.txt => /etc/blah/sample.conf

Or using markup:

#! /usr/bin/dh-exec-install
etc/whatever.txt /etc/blah/sample.conf # +mv

It could perhaps go to the previous line:

#! /usr/bin/dh-exec-install
# +mv
etc/whatever.txt /etc/blah/sample.conf

But this is not easy to glance at and understand, the former two look
more reasonable.
