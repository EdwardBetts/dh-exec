* dh-exec-install
The syntax needs to be rethought, so that the tool can be enabled
again.

Perhaps something like:

#! /usr/bin/dh-exec-install
usr/lib/libblah.so.*
usr/lib/libblah-plugin-*.so /usr/lib/blah/${UPSTREAM_VERSION}/
etc/whatever.txt => /etc/blah/sample.conf

The way this should work, is that it'd copy stuff to
debian/tmp/dh-exec.${random}, with a new name, and add that
appropriately to the output.

So etc/whatever.txt would become
debian/tmp/dh-exec.${random}/etc/blah/sample.conf, and the resulting
output from the command would be something like the following:

usr/lib/libblah.so.*
usr/lib/libblah-plugin-*.so /usr/lib/blah/${UPSTREAM_VERSION}/
dh-exec.${random}/etc/blah/sample.conf /etc/blah/

The reason behind (ab)using debian/tmp is that it gets cleaned up by
dh_prep.
