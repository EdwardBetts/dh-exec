* dh-exec
More documentation, a HOWTO in the manpage.

** Move the individual tools to /usr/lib/dh-exec
The individual dh-exec-* tools need not be on the path, move them to
/usr/lib/dh-exec instead.

** Allow explicitly enabling/disabling various tools
Add a --with= and a --without= option to dh-exec, so that we can turn
tools on and off.
