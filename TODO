* dh_exec
** Documentation!
The command needs a manpage.

* dh_exec_install
This needs some rethinking. The syntax is bad, and the way it works
will break various dh_install assumptions (-X, --sourcedir, --tmpdir
and the like).

Leave the code in the tree, but disable it for now.

* Examples
As a kind of documentation, I'd like to add a couple of examples, with
suitable amounts of documentation to showcase how the dh-exec tools
shall be used.
