* dh_exec
** Support running dh-exec-install last
If we want variable substitution in .install files, then we must run
dh-exec-subst first. But dh-exec-install can't read from stdin, as it
wants to double-check the filename.

The solution here is to check the filename, if it exists, or use
DH_EXEC_SOURCE, and export the latter from dh-exec.

** Documentation!
The command needs a manpage.

* Examples
As a kind of documentation, I'd like to add a couple of examples, with
suitable amounts of documentation to showcase how the dh-exec tools
shall be used.
