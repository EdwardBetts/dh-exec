.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh\-exec is a simple program, meant to be used as the interpreter for
executable debhelper config files.

It is a wrapper around the various other helpers (see below), and will
pipe the input file through all of them in turn, using an ordering
that makes most sense in the vast majority of cases.

The order as of now is \fIdh\-exec\-subst\fR gets run first, followed
by \fIdh\-exec\-install\fR, so that variable expansion happens before
files need to be copied.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.IP "\fB\-\-with\fR=\fIhelper\fR[\fB,\fR\fIhelper\fR ...]" 4
Replace the list of helpers to run the input through with a custom
list (where entries are separated by whitespace or commas). This
option will always replace the existing list with whatever is
specified.

This can be used to explicitly set which helpers to use.

The list \fBmust not\fR include the \fIdh\-exec\-\fR prefix.

Defaults to \fIsubst,install\fR.

.IP "\fB\-\-without\fR=\fIhelper\fR[\fB,\fR\fIhelper\fR ...]" 4
Inversely to the option above, this lists all the helpers which should
not be used.

The list \fBmust not\fR include the \fIdh\-exec\-\fR prefix.

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-act" 4
Do not really do anything, but print the pipeline that would have been
run instead.

.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
Display a short help or the package version, respectively.
